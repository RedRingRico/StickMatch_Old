After going through the code, here are my initial thoughts on how to proceed
improving upon what's available

* The whole game should be in C
* Stick figures should not be completely separate classes, they shoudld be
  modified via their properties.
* Timer should be changed from using the SDL_GetTicks function to using the
  native OS's high-resolution timer for microsecond resolution.
* The Health_Status member function in RedStick and BlueStick is terribly
  constructed.  Scaling the health bar would be much better for performance.
* Header guards are not present, they should be.
* Using a fixed-timestep instead of waiting for the main loop to complete
  before blanking the screen would be ideal.
* Using a text-based format for defining the stick fighters would help with
  testing without re-compiling.
* Animations should be loaded from file, perhaps with the stick fighter
  definition file.
* Add a Linux build
* It would be nice to do all of this in 3D
* The error and output log files should be dumped in the executable's directory
